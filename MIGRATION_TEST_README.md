# üß™ Notes Migration Test

This test verifies that the migration from the old `notesHtml` system to the new SVG-based notes system works correctly.

## How to Run the Test

1. **Open the test page**: Open `migration-test.html` in your browser
2. **Follow the 4 steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Setup Test Data - Creates test customers with old `notesHtml` data
   - **Step 2**: Run Migration - Converts old notes to new SVG system
   - **Step 3**: Verify Results - Checks that migration worked correctly
   - **Step 4**: Cleanup - Removes test data

## What the Test Does

### Test Data Created:
- **Customer 1**: `"Glasses, children, two boys"` (with styling)
- **Customer 2**: `"introduced by Charlie, last had her hair cut by Takeshi about 4 years ago"` (with styling)
- **Customer 3**: `<p><br></p>` (empty note - should be skipped)
- **Customer 4**: `"Simple text note without styling"` (plain text)

### Migration Process:
1. **Reads** old `notesHtml` from IndexedDB
2. **Converts** HTML content to SVG format
3. **Saves** new SVG notes to localStorage
4. **Removes** old `notesHtml` from customer records
5. **Shows** detailed console logs

### Verification Checks:
- ‚úÖ Notes were converted to SVG format
- ‚úÖ SVG contains the original text content
- ‚úÖ Notes were saved to localStorage
- ‚úÖ Old `notesHtml` was removed from IndexedDB
- ‚úÖ Empty notes were skipped
- ‚úÖ Note numbering is correct

## Expected Results

After running the test, you should see:
- **3 customers migrated** (Customer 3 with empty note should be skipped)
- **3 SVG notes created** in localStorage
- **0 customers still have notesHtml** in IndexedDB
- **Console logs** showing the conversion process

## Console Output

The test provides detailed console logging:
```
üß™ Starting migration test...
Found 4 total customers
üìù Migrating notes for customer test-customer-1: Test Customer 1
   Original notesHtml: <p><span style="...">Glasses, children, two boys</span></p>
   Converted SVG: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="400" height="100"...

## Files Used

- `migration-test.html` - Test interface
- `migration-test.js` - Standalone migration functions
- `js/db.js` - Database functions
- `js/app.js` - Main app (contains the actual migration function)

## Success Criteria

The test passes if:
1. All non-empty `notesHtml` notes are converted to SVG
2. SVG contains the original text content
3. Notes are properly saved to localStorage
4. Old `notesHtml` fields are removed from IndexedDB
5. Empty notes are skipped
6. No errors occur during the process

This test ensures that when you deploy the new system, all existing notes from your iPad will be safely migrated to the new format.
