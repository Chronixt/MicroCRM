The outcome of this project is to create a html front end that will act as a calendar organiser, customer record database and be accessible on an ipad. The caviat with this is that there needs to be a way to allow the user to enter all information via writing in Japanese with the apple pencil.

Hard Requirements
- Form like front end ui
- Ability to enter data in Japanese directly using the apple pencil
- Must work on ipad, whether that is with a html front end accessed through safari or some other means
- Will have the following functions;
    - An embedded calendar, ideally one that is able to push items too or from the ios calendar
    - A form that allows the user to record customer details and will have the following fields
        - First Name (text entry box)
        - Last Name (text entry box)
        - Contact Number (text entry box)
        - Referral Type(drop down menu with Walk in, Friend, Instagram, Website, Google Maps, Other)
        - Referral notes (text box for user to enter things relevant to referral type)
        - Notes (Multi line text box with formatting options)
        - There should also be a place in each customer record where the user can attach image files specific to that user
    - The ability for the user to then find an individual customer record and update that record or book an appointment on the calendar
        - There needs to be a search bar or similar to allow the user to quickly query and access customer records
        - The customer record edit/update system will allow the user to add notes and book appointments in the calendar
        - The user should not be able to edit other customer details in update/book mode, but there should be an extra "Edit Record" button on the screen
    - Use the customer record to create appointments on the embedded calendar for that customer
- When the user accesses the ui, the first screen will be a menu screen with 3 option
    - Add new record
    - Find customer record
    - Calendar
