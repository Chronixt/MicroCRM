# Chikas DB PWA Deployment Guide

## Overview

Your Chikas DB app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on iPads and work offline with local database storage.

## What You Get

✅ **Offline functionality** - App works without internet  
✅ **Local database** - IndexedDB stores all data locally  
✅ **Installable** - Can be added to iPad home screen  
✅ **File downloads** - Backup/restore functionality works  
✅ **App-like experience** - Looks and feels like a native app  

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Development Server (Testing)

1. **Start your local server:**
   ```bash
   # If you have Python installed
   python -m http.server 5500
   
   # Or if you have Node.js
   npx serve . --listen 5500
   ```

2. **Access on iPad:**
   - Connect iPad to same WiFi network as your computer
   - Open Safari on iPad
   - Navigate to: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5500`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5500`

### Option 2: Web Hosting (Production)

1. **Upload files to web hosting service:**
   - Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any web hosting
   - Must support HTTPS (required for PWA)

2. **Required files to upload:**
   ```
   index.html
   styles.css
   js/app.js
   js/db.js
   manifest.json
   sw.js
   assets/bg.jpg
   assets/icon-192.png (create this)
   assets/icon-512.png (create this)
   ```

### Option 3: Raspberry Pi / Home Server

1. **Set up a Raspberry Pi with web server**
2. **Configure port forwarding** on your router
3. **Access from anywhere** via your public IP

## iPad Installation Steps

1. **Open Safari** on your iPad
2. **Navigate to your app** (local server or hosted URL)
3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)
4. **Tap "Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Customize the name** if desired
6. **Tap "Add"**

Your app will now appear as an icon on the home screen!

## Testing Offline Functionality

1. **Install the app** on your iPad home screen
2. **Open the app** from the home screen
3. **Turn off WiFi** or put iPad in airplane mode
4. **Test the app** - it should work offline
5. **Add customers/appointments** - they'll be stored locally
6. **Reconnect to internet** - data will sync when you refresh

## Database & Backup Features

### Local Storage
- **IndexedDB** stores all data locally on the iPad
- **No internet required** for daily operations
- **Data persists** between app sessions

### Backup/Restore
- **Export data** creates downloadable JSON files
- **Import data** restores from backup files
- **Works offline** - files are processed locally

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
- Ensure you're using Safari (not Chrome/Firefox)
- Check that HTTPS is enabled (for hosted versions)
- Verify manifest.json is accessible

### Offline Not Working
- Check that service worker is registered (check browser console)
- Ensure all files are being cached
- Try refreshing the page

### Icons Not Showing
- Verify icon files exist in assets/ folder
- Check file paths in manifest.json
- Clear browser cache and try again

## Security Considerations

- **Local data only** - no data sent to external servers
- **HTTPS required** for PWA features (when hosted)
- **Regular backups** recommended for data safety

## Next Steps

1. **Create app icons** (see ICONS_README.md)
2. **Test on iPad** using local server
3. **Deploy to hosting** for production use
4. **Train staff** on iPad usage
5. **Set up regular backup** procedures

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all files are accessible
3. Test with different browsers/devices
4. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (for hosted versions)
